# Travel-Recommendation-System

Tourism Recommendation System:

## Introduction

The tourism and travel industry has been growing rapidly in recent years, with millions of people traveling to different destinations yearly. However, the process of finding suitable accommodations, activities, and flights can be overwhelming for tourists, leading to a need for a recommendation system that can provide personalized recommendations based on their preferences and history.

## Market Size

The global tourism and travel industry is expected to grow to $15.5 trillion by 2026, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council. With the increasing demand for travel and tourism, the need for a recommendation system is higher than ever, making this project a promising investment opportunity.


## Business Problem

The travel and tourism industry is growing rapidly, and tourists often face challenges when planning their trips. They have to spend time researching different options for accommodations, activities, and flights, which can be overwhelming and time-consuming. The aim of this project is to develop a personalized recommendation system for tourists, which will help them make informed decisions about their trip by providing recommendations for all aspects of their journey.

The app will function like TikTok or Tinder, where users will be shown bundles of trips that have almost every part of the trip covered. Users can like, dislike, or book the trip, allowing the system to continuously learn the user's behavior and make better recommendations over time. This will result in a personalized experience for each user, providing recommendations that are tailored to their individual preferences and history.


## Technologies

Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) for Attractions Recommendations: RBM is a deep learning technique that will be used to provide personalized recommendations for attractions.
Matrix Factorization with Alternating Least Squares (ALS) for Hotels Recommendations: ALS is a highly scalable and distributed collaborative filtering technique that will be used to provide personalized recommendations for hotels.
Hybrid of K-Means and K-Nearest Neighbors for Restaurants Recommendations: This combination of algorithms will be used to provide content-based filtering and memory-based collaborative filtering recommendations for restaurants.
Alternating Least Squares with Weighted Regularization (ALS-WR) for Flights Recommendations: ALS-WR is a model that will be used to provide personalized recommendations for flights.


## Data Sources

Yelp free database
Google Maps (for attractions and hotels)
 Averaged historical flight data (can be applied to live data)
Other possible data sources such as web scraping

## Tools and Libraries

Python programming language
Scikit-learn library for machine learning
NumPy library for numerical computing
Pandas library for data analysis
Other suitable libraries and tools may be used as needed.

## Deliverables

Data Collection and Preparation: This stage will involve collecting data from various sources, cleaning and preprocessing the data, and preparing it for use in the recommendation system.
Model Development: In this stage, the different models for each trip aspect will be developed and tested. This includes RBM for attractions, ALS for hotels, a Hybrid of K-Means and K-Nearest Neighbors for restaurants, and ALS-WR for flights.
Integration of Different Models: In this stage, the different models developed in stage 2 will be integrated into a single recommendation system.
Deployment: The recommendation system will be deployed, allowing users to access it and receive personalized recommendations for their trips.

## Further Plans: 

User Testing and Feedback: User testing will be conducted to gather feedback on the recommendation system and make any necessary improvements.
Ongoing Maintenance and Updates: The recommendation system will be maintained and updated on an ongoing basis to ensure its continued performance and accuracy.
Performance Evaluation: Regular performance evaluations will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the recommendation system and make any necessary improvements.
